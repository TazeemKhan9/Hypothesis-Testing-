# Hypothesis-Testing-
To prove that the mathematical processing of males was equal to that of the females.

## How did we try to find the answer for the above hypothesis?
Conducted a survey in and around our college physically by asking people a basic but tricky maths question.The question was to calculate simple math series 1+1=2,2+2=4,4+4=8,8+8=16 and so on. There were two criterias which had been established, for the question one was the the answer must be right and the answers must not have a gap of more than 5 seconds.

## Calculating Results-
A 2 sample T-test was used for checking if our assumed hypothesis was correct or not. The results of the T-test was also supported by visualisation and other methods to extract information from data which can be seen in the results file.
